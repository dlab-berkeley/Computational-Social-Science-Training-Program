# Introduction to GitHub

Throughout this course, we'll be using a platform called [GitHub](https://github.com/). GitHub is a popular code hosting platform. It has lots of features that make version control and collaboration easier. Version control refers to the techniques for managing changes to software and code, and easily going back and forth between older and new versions of a code base. Getting familiar with GitHub and all of its tools can take some time, but the benefits for open science and streamlined collaboration are worth it.

At some point in your career, you have probably found yourself in a situation like this:

GitHub is a useful tool because it removes a lot of the obstacles that we usually face when we are collaborating with others. Instead of saving multiple versions of the same document, GitHub lets us iterate on the same document while recording how it has changed over time. Rather than sending collaborators messily named documents, everyone can work from the same GitHub repository. GitHub also has tools for resolving editing conflicts between collaborators and creating a clear workflow.

# Getting Started

First, let's get started by making GitHub accounts. Navigate to GitHub's [homepage](https://github.com). Navigate to "Sign Up" in the top right hand side of the page. I recommend you create an account using your berkeley.edu account.
