    "For the next few labs, we will use the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's [Consumer Complaint Database](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/). The database is rich with information about individual consumer complaints about credit card fraud, debt collections, and other consumer issues. This dataset is convenient for text analysis because the consumer complaints are real text generated by real people. This means that the data have all the idiosyncrasies that come with those data-generating processes. It also contains multiple different categories that we can predict, like type of product the complaint is about and whether the complaint was resolved quickly. \n",

Whereas bag-of-words counts the number of words in the document, tf-idf takes this quanity and divides it by how frequently the word shows up across the corpus. In doing so, the tf-idf score downweights words that are common in the corpus and thus would not aid with classification.\n",
