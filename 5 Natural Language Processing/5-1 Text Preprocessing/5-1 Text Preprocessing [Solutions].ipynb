This helps to prevent conflicts between dependencies across different projects and ensures that you are using the correct versions of packages. You must have created anaconda virtual enviornment in the `Anaconda Installation` lab. If you have not or want to create a new virtual environment, follow the instruction in the `Anaconda Installation` lab. If you have already created a virtual enviornment, you can run the following command to activate it. <br>\n",

    "For the next few labs, we will use the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's [Consumer Complaint Database](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/). The database is rich with information about individual consumer complaints about credit card fraud, debt collections, and other consumer issues. This dataset is convenient for text analysis because the consumer complaints are real text generated by real people - and have all the idiosyncrasies that come with that process. It also contains multiple different categories that we can predict, like type of product the complaint is about and whether the complaint was resolved quickly. The basic process is that if someone has a dispute related to consumer finance (mortgages, student loans, credit cards, etc.), they can file a dispute with the CFPB, which then contacts the company named in the dispute to get some resolution of the issue."
