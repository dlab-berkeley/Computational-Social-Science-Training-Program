However the Colab notebook requires you to be connected to the internet, while jupyter notebooks can be run on your local machine. Google Colab notebooks are in the .ipynb format, and can be saved and opened either directly or via Google Drive. \n",

    "### Reshaping\n",
    "[Reshaping](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/reshape) is another key operation for manipulating tensors. Reshaping tensors, like arrays, can include switching, increasing, and decreasing dimensions. For example, you can change the three dimensional tensor into one dimension or two dimensions. The best way to understand the arguments for reshaping is to practice and look at examples. A series of sample reshapings are given below."

However, there are many strategies can help you navigate the model ecosystem, some of which we will discuss here: \n",

    "1. Documentation (and other resources like tutorials) is a goldmine of information for implementing particular algorithms and completing specific tasks. This is one reason why reading and translating code written by others is a key skill. \n",

    "3. Computational resources are important for running complex models. Google Colab has access to GPUs, but does have limitations for large and extended jobs. In those cases, options are paid services such as Google Colab Pro or on-campus [resources](https://docs-research-it.berkeley.edu/services/high-performance-computing/overview/). \n",
