We're going to work with [Census Income dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income) on the UCI Machine Learning Repository. In supervised machine learning, we start with a structured dataset where each observation is a row and each variable is a column. The goal is to use a number of features (previously you might have called these \"covariates,\" \"independent variables,\" or \"regressors\") to train a model that predicts a target (previously you might have called these \"outcome variable\" or \"dependent variable\"). In this case, we will use information like age, education, and marital status to predict each person's income-bracket.\n",

    "This data preprocessing reveals two important concepts in machine learning. Namely, [**the curse of dimensionality** and **sparsity**](https://www.kaggle.com/residentmario/curse-of-dimensionality). A sparse matrix is one filled mainly with 0s, as we see above. In geometric terms, this property means that most combinations of features are totally empty. The curse of dimensionality refers to the idea that as the number of features grow, the number of observations needed to properly model predictions grows as well. The problem is that that number of observations required grows much faster than the number of features. Trading off between increasing features to improve model performance, but reducing the number of features to avoid the instability and overfitting that occurs with too few observations, is at the heart of supervised machine learning. In the coming weeks, we will learn more about how to conceptualize and make these tradeoffs."

    "Another key aspect of machine learning is splitting our data. In your previous statistics classes, you likely fit regression models on an entire dataset. The problem with fitting a model this way is that models will tend to perform better on the data that they are trained on, but then perform less well on out of sample data. The error in a machine learning model comes from two sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bias**: Error arising from the difference between the predicted output and the actual output. High bias models tend to be too simple and **underfit** the dataset.\n",

    "**Variance**: Error arising from modeling the noise in the output. High variance models tend to be too complex and **overfit** the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [**bias-variance tradeoff**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias%E2%80%93variance_tradeoff) is a fundamental concept in machine learning. The less bias in a model, the higher the variance and vice versa. [Underfitting or overfitting](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_underfitting_overfitting.html) a model makes generalizing to new data difficult. Trading off between these two sources of error is an essential part of machine learning. Over the next few weeks, we will explore how to deal with bias-variance tradeoff in the modeling process. Today, we'll look at how our choices in the data splitting step affect bias-variance tradeoff as well."
