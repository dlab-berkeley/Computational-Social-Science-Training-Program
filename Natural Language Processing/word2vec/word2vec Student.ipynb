    "## Overview <a id='context'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will be turning individual words in the data set into vectors, called \"Word Embeddings\". Word embedding attempt to identify semantic relationships between words by observing them in the context that the word appears. Word2Vec is the most prominent word embedding algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that each word in a novel has its meaning determined by the ones that surround it in a limited window. For example, in Moby Dick's first sentence, “me” is paired on either side by “Call” and “Ishmael.” After observing the windows around every word in the novel (or many novels), the computer will notice a pattern in which “me” falls between similar pairs of words to “her,” “him,” or “them.” Of course, the computer had gone through a similar process over the words “Call” and “Ishmael,” for which “me” is reciprocally part of their contexts.  This chaining of signifiers to one another mirrors some of humanists' most sophisticated interpretative frameworks of language.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two main flavors of Word2Vec are CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words) and Skip-Gram, which can be distinguished partly by their input and output during training. Skip-Gram takes a word of interest as its input (e.g. \"me\") and tries to learn how to predict its context words (\"Call\",\"Ishmael\"). CBOW does the opposite, taking the context words (\"Call\",\"Ishmael\") as a single input and tries to predict the word of interest (\"me\").\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, CBOW is is faster and does well with frequent words, while Skip-Gram potentially represents rare words better.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Word2Vec Features\n",
    "\n",
    "* `size`: Number of dimensions for word embedding model\n",
    "* `window`: Number of context words to observe in each direction\n",
    "* `min_count`: Minimum frequency for words included in model\n",
    "* `sg` (Skip-Gram): '0' indicates CBOW model; '1' indicates Skip-Gram\n",
    "* `alpha`: Learning rate (initial); prevents model from over-correcting, enables finer tuning\n",
    "* `iterations`: Number of passes through dataset\n",
    "* `batch_words`: Number of words to sample from data during each pass\n",

However, this isn't perfect! And as with any machine learning application, your choice of model and hyperparameters can matter quite a lot. In this case, some of our simpler featurizations and models actually did better than word embeddings, but this won't always be true. It is also worth learning more about other embeddings like [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/), transformer based models like [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) and deep learning approaches like [ELMo](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05365)."
